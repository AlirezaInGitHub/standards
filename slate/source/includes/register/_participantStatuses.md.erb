# Participant Statuses

## Accredited Data Recipient and Software Product Statuses
The accreditation status of Accredited Data Recipients, and the status of their associated software products, may traverse through multiple statuses in the CDR as a result of decisions by the ACCC, in its capacity as Data Recipient Accreditor, or where an Accredited Data Recipient surrenders accreditation.

Data Holders will have the responsibility to ensure that CDR data relating to consumers is disclosed to Accredited Data Recipients and to cease sharing data where the accreditation of a data recipient is

1.	Suspended or revoked by the ACCC
2.	Surrendered by the Data Recipient

The Register will notify all Data Holders of the above changes in Accredited Data Recipient status as per the ACCCâ€™s decisions.

### Status Mapping
When the ACCC Registrar changes the accreditation status for an ADR for any status other than active, the associated Software Products status will be changed accordingly.

The cascading status mappings are as follows:

|**ADR Status**|**Cascaded SP Status**|
|-----------------|-----------------------|
|Suspended|Inactive|
|Revoked|Removed|
|Surrendered|Removed|

These cascaded software product statuses are also catered for in collection arrangements. Please refer to the [Accreditation Status Discovery](#collection-arrangements) section for more details.

### Collection Arrangements
The status of a software product, managed within a collection arrangement, will be coupled to the accreditation status of both the principal and provider in this arrangement.

To achieve this, cascade rules for software product statuses, as defined in [Status Mapping](#accredited-data-recipient-and-software-product-statuses), will be defined for a collection arrangement as follows:

| Provider Status | Principal Status | Cascaded Principal SP Status
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
| Active |	Active | Active
| Suspended |	Active | Inactive
| Revoked |	Active | Inactive
| Surrendered |	Active | Inactive
| Any |	Suspended | Inactive
| Any |	Revoked | Removed
| Any |	Surrendered | Removed


### Archiving Entities
In order to keep the Register APIs efficient and to minimise the amount of metadata traffic, dormant entries will be identified and archived automatically within the CDR Register.

Dormant entries are defined as those records that have reached and maintained an __end state__ in the CDR Register for the past **2 years**.

Each entity within the CDR Register can be archived independently of the parent entity. For example, a software product that has been dormant for **2 years** can be archived whilst the brand remains active. However, if a parent entity is archived (Legal Entity / Brand) then all child entities will also be archived.

The table below outlines the end state for each Register entry type:

|**Register Entity**|**End State**|
|-----------------|-----------------------|
|Data Holder|Removed|
|Data Holder Brand|Removed|
|Data Recipient|Surrendered, Revoked|
|Data Recipient Brand|Removed|
|Data Recipient Software Product|Removed|

When an entry is archived on the Register, the entry will no longer appear in the output of the Register APIs by default. The archived records will still be accessible, if needed, by providing a query string parameter `include-archived=true` on the request.



## Data Holder Responsibilities
</br>The ACCC Registrar has the ability to change the status of a Software Product independently of the ADR accreditation status. Therefore, both the ADR and Software Product statuses should be referenced, to determine the Data Holder's responsibilities for data disclosure, consent and registration management
'

|**ADR Status**|**SP Status**|**Disclose of CDR Data**|**Facilitate Consent Authorisation**|**Facilitate Consent Withdrawal**|**Invalidate Consents**|**Cleanup Registration**|
|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|Active|Active|<i class="icon-check"></i>|<i class="icon-check"></i>|<i class="icon-check"></i>| | |
|Active|Inactive| | |<i class="icon-check"></i>| | |
|Active|Removed| | | | <i class="icon-check"></i> | <i class="icon-check"></i> |
|Suspended|Inactive| | |<i class="icon-check"></i>| | |
|Suspended|Removed| | | | <i class="icon-check"></i> | <i class="icon-check"></i> |
|Revoked|Removed|	| | | <i class="icon-check"></i> | <i class="icon-check"></i> |
|Surrendered|Removed| | | | <i class="icon-check"></i> | <i class="icon-check"></i> |

* Disclosure of CDR data MUST be in response to valid requests in accordance with the CDR rules and standards
* The status of an Accredited Data Recipient Brand does not impact Data Holder responsibilities due to the cascade rules outlined above
* When an Accredited Data Recipient status is Suspended, Revoked or Surrendered the Software Product status cannot be Active
* Invalidation of consents and cleanup of registrations are bulk operations. It is reasonable to execute these as batch tasks performed overnight


## Metadata Cache Management
Data Holders are required to be able to react to Data Recipient and associated Software Statuses changes within **5 minutes** of the change occuring on the CDR Register

To achieve this, Data Holders can poll the [GetDataRecipientsStatus](#getdatarecipientsstatus), [GetSoftwareProductsStatus](#getsoftwareproductsstatus) and [GetDataRecipients](#getdatarecipients) APIs to retrieve the current statuses and cache these for use during requests for Consumer Data

Data Holders will need to choose a frequency of polling which ensures their systems can respond to status changes within the required timeframe


Data Holders and Data Recipients will be required to cache all other participant data they use and periodically update this cache using a slow poll. This ensures that changes to participant configuration propagates throughout the ecosystem in a predictable timeframe

### Cache update periods
The following are the recommended caching times for data retrieved from the Register APIs.

| API | Type | Period |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
|**GetDataRecipientsStatus**|	Public | 2-5 minutes |
|**GetSoftwareProductsStatus**|	Public | 2-5 minutes |
|**GetDataRecipients (statuses)**| Public | 2-5 minutes |
|**GetDataRecipients (other data)**| Public | 6 hours |
|**GetDataHolderBrands**| Private | 6 hours |


## ETag Support
All **public** APIs are hosted on a CDN supporting ETag cache validators. ETags can be utilised to detect whether the content has changed.

Further information on the usage of `ETag` and the associated `If-None-Match` headers can be found at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/cdn/cdn-how-caching-works](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/cdn/cdn-how-caching-works)
