# Introduction

These standards have been developed as part of the Australian Government's introduction of the [Consumer Data Right](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right "ACCC Consumer Data Right webpage") legislation to give Australians greater control over their data.

The Consumer Data Right is intended to be applied sector by sector across the whole economy, beginning in the banking, energy and telecommunications sectors.  These standards have been developed to facilitate the Consumer Data Right by acting as a specific baseline for implementation.

CSIRO’s Data61 has been appointed as the technical advisor and provider of operational support to the interim data standards body. These standards have been prepared by the Consumer Data Standards team at Data61.  The work of the team is  overseen by Mr. Andrew Stevens as interim Chair, with industry and consumer advice provided by an Advisory Committee. Data61’s Consumer Data Standards team works closely with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as lead regulator of the Consumer Data Right, supported by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).

These standards will be binding data standards for the purposes of s56FA and in accordance with the Consumer Data Right rules made by the ACCC. The making and commencement of the data standards and the CDR rules is subject to the Consumer Data Right legislation.
