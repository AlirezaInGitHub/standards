# Introduction

These standards have been developed as part of the introduction in Australia of the [Consumer Data Right](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right "ACCC Consumer Data Right webpage") legislation to give Australians greater control over their data.

The Consumer Data Right is intended to apply sector by sector across the whole economy, beginning in the banking, energy and telecommunications sectors.  These standards have been developed to facilitate the Consumer Data Right by acting as a specific baseline for implementation.

These standards are governed by the Consumer Data Standards team inside Data61.  Data61 has been appointed as the interim standards body. The work of the team is  overseen by Mr. Andrew Stevens as interim Chair, with industry and consumer advice provided by an Advisory Committee. Data61 works closely with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as lead regulator of the Consumer Data Right, supported by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).

Note that security standards are only partially represented in these standards as they are under development by the Information Security Working Group.  More detail can found at the [Information Security Profile](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/infosec) working draft.
