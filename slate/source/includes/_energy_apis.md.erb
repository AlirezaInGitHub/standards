This specification defines the APIs for Data Holders exposing Energy endpoints.

Corrections:

- Changed the conditional statement for EnergyPlanContract_variation such that the field is mandatory if the EnergyPlanContract_isFixed flag is `false`.
- Removed `location` as a required property. It is included outside of the EnergyServicePointDetail_relatedParticipants object but incorrectly "required" by the sibling object.
