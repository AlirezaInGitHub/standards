## Data Recipient Requirements
Data Recipient Software Products will be limited by the traffic thresholds documented in the previous section.  In addition to this Data Recipients are expected to design their services according to the following principles:

- Services should be designed to minimise traffic with Data Holders
- Services should be designed to be resilient in the case of the rejection of a call by a Data Holder due to traffic threshold breaches
- Services should schedule unattended calls to avoid high traffic periods
- Unattended calls should be managed to avoid short term bursts of traffic
