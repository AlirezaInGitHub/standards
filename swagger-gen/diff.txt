< |minimumValue|[Number](#common-field-types)|mandatory|none|The number of tierUnitOfMeasure units that form the lower bound of the tier. The tier should be inclusive of this value|
< |maximumValue|[Number](#common-field-types)|optional|none|The number of tierUnitOfMeasure units that form the upper bound of the tier or band. For a tier with a discrete value (as opposed to a range of values e.g. 1 month) this must be the same as tierValueMinimum. Where this is the same as the tierValueMinimum value of the next-higher tier the referenced tier should be exclusive of this value. For example a term deposit of 2 months falls into the upper tier of the following tiers: (1 – 2 months, 2 – 3 months). If absent the tier's range has no upper bound.|
